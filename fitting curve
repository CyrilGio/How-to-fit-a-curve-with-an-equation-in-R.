Hi Community,

I need to fit a curve with this equation : (-k*t+To)+t^-0,5

"k" and "To" are two constant and "t" is my time.

I did this fit on Excel thanks to the solver with the below conditions :

    - Sum of square (SSR) : I want the minimum
    - I want to find the better "k" and "To"


However I don't know how I can do this on R.

My aim : I want to fit my curve on R with this equation and find k and To.

For example, I did that just below but I have three problems (and maybe it's not the good solution):

    - It give me a linear regression
    - My coefficient aren't free (I need to find a solution where my coefficients can change in function of the better result found by R).
    - My last line code doesn't works


t <- PLR2decroissance$pupil_timestamp_secondes      # these are my time points
k <- 2.5         # time constant
To <- 0.48        # growth constant
y <- (-k*t+To)+t^-0.5 # my equation

# visualise
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(t, y)    
lines(PLR2decroissance$pupil_timestamp_secondes , PLR2decroissance$diameter_3d_corrige ,  col="red")

Thank you very much for your help.

Yours sincerely,
